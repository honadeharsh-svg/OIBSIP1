        <h2>Why I Admire Steve Jobs</h2>
       <p>
        
        Steve Jobs inspires me with his vision, innovation, and perseverance. As the co-founder of Apple, he revolutionized
        technology by creating products that combined functionality with beauty, such as the iPhone, iPad, and Mac. His ability
        to think differently and challenge the status quo made him one of the most influential entrepreneurs in history.
        </p>
        <p>Beyond their professional success, their kindness and empathy make them a role model for everyone. Their
            words and actions motivate me to pursue my dreams.</p>
